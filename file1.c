Charles Hodge (1797â€“1878) was a Presbyterian theologian and principal of Princeton Theological Seminary between 1851 and 1878.
He was a leading exponent of the Princeton theology, an orthodox Calvinist theological tradition in America during the 
19th century. He argued strongly for the authority of the Bible as the Word of God. 
Many of his ideas were adopted in the 20th century by Fundamentalists and Evangelicals.
